Request creation

I have an environment variable as {‌{url}}. Can I use it inside a script (like pm.sendRequest)?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following syntax will not work while writing scripts: ::

    pm.sendRequest({‌{url}}/mediaitem/)

You are inside a script, so you need to use the pm.* API to get to that variable. The syntax {‌{url}} works only inside the request builder, not in scripts.

Example: ::

    var requestUrl = pm.environment.get("url") + "/mediaitem/"); 
        
    pm.sendRequest(requestUrl, function (err, res) {
        // do stuff
    });


How to use pre-request script to pass dynamic data in the request body?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the pre-request script you can simply create a JavaScript object, set the desired values and save it as a variable () 

For example if you want to send a request body that looks like: ::

    {
        "firstName": "First Name",
        "lastName": "Last Name",
        "email": "test@example.com"
    }

You can do the following in the pre-request script: ::

    // Define a new object
    var user = {
        "firstName": "First Name",
        "lastName": "Last Name",
        "email": "test@example.com"
    }

    // Save the object as a variable. 
    // JSON.stringify will serialize the object so that Postman can save it
    pm.globals.set('user', JSON.stringify(user));

In the request body you can simply use ``{{user}}``. This also works just as well for nested objects: ::

    {
        "user": {{user}}
        "address": {
            "street": "Foo"
            "number": "2"
            "city": "Bar"
        }
    }


How to generate random data?
----------------------------

**Option 1** Using existing Postman random generators

If you need to create an unique string (with every request) and pass it in the request body, in the example below there will be generated an unique GroupName everytime the request is executed.

You can use the variable ``{‌{$guid}}`` - this is automatically generated by Postman. Or you can use the current timestamp, ``{‌{$timestamp}}``::

    {
        "GroupName":"GroupName_{‌{$guid}}",
        "Description": "Example_API_Admin-Group_Description"
    }

This will generate something like: ::

    {
        "GroupName":"GroupName_0542bd53-f030-4e3b-b7bc-d496e71d16a0",
        "Description": "Example_API_Admin-Group_Description"
    }

The disadvantage of this method is that you cannot use these special variables in a pre-request script or test. Additionally they will be only generated once per request, so using ``{‌{$guid}}`` more than once will generate the same data in a request.

**Option 2** Using existing JavaScript random generators

Below you will find an exemple function that you can use to generate integer number between a specific interval: ::

    function getRandomNumber(minValue, maxValue) {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * (maxValue - minValue +1)) + min;
    }

You can call the function like this: ::

    var myRandomNumber = getRandomNumber(0, 100);

And the output will look similar to: ::

    67


Below you will find an exemple function that you can use to generate random strings: ::

    function getRandomString() {
        Math.random().toString(36).substring(2);
    }

You can call the function like this: ::

    var myRandomNumber = getRandomString();

And the output will look similar to: ::

How to trigger another request from pre-request script?
----------------------------------------------------------------

**Option 1** You can trigger another request in the collection from the pre-request script using ``postman.setNextRequest``.

That can be done with: ::

    postman.setNextRequest('Your request name as saved in Postman'); 

The difficulty is returning to the request that initiated the call. Additionally you need to make sure you do not create endless loops. 

**Option 2** Another possibility is making an HTTP call from the pre-request script to fetch any data you might need.

Below I am fetching a name from a remote API and setting it as a variable for use in the actual request that will execute right after the pre-request script completed: ::

    var options = { method: 'GET',
      url: 'http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a849eee300000580069b022'
    };

    pm.sendRequest(options, function (error, response) {
        if (error) throw new Error(error);
        var jsonData = response.json();
        pm.globals.set('name', 'jsonData.name');
    });

**Tip** You can generate such requests by using the "Code" generator button right below the Save button, once you have a request that works. There you can Select NodeJS > Request and the syntax generated is very similar to what Postman expects. 

You can import this example in Postman by using this link: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/5a61c265d4a7bbd8b303


How to pass arrays and objects between requests?
------------------------------------------------

Assuming your response is in JSON format, You can extract data from the response by using ::

    var jsonData = pm.response.json();

After this you can set the whole response (or just a subset like this): ::

    pm.environment.set('myData', JSON.stringify(jsonData)); 

You need to use JSON.stringify() before saving objects / arrays to a Postman variable. Otherwise it will not work.

In the next request where you want to retrieve the data, just use:

- ``{myData}}`` if you are inside the request builder
- ``var myData = JSON.parse(pm.environment.get('myData'));``

Using JSON.stringify and JSON.parse methods is not needed if the values are strings or integers or booleans. 

JSON.stringify() converts a value to a JSON string while JSON.parse() method parses a JSON string, creating the value described by the string.


How to read external files?
---------------------------

If you have some information saved on a file locally on your computer, you might want to access this information with Postman.

Unfortunately this is not really possible. There is a way to read a data file in JSON or CSV format, which allows you to make some variables dynamic. These variables are called data variables and are mostly used for testing different iterations on a specific request or collection.

The alternative would be to start a local server to serve that file and to get it in Postman with a GET request.
